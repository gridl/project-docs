Zephyr Project Documentation
############################


The Zephyr |trade| Project is a scalable real-time operating system (RTOS)
supporting multiple hardware architectures, optimized for resource constrained
devices, and built with security in mind.

The majority of Zephyr Kernel-specific documentation is published at
https://zephyrproject.org/doc.

The content you're reading here is additional non-Kernel related documents
about the Zephyr project itself that are part of the moderated and
reviewed project documentation.

We also maintain a `wiki on GitHub`_ for informal contributions and
collaboration.
